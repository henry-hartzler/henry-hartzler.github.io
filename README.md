# Henry Hartzler, Web Developer

## Portfolio Website
+ This website showcases the my keen attention to detail and expertise in CSS animations and responsive web design.

## What I'm working on:
+ Currently, I am learning React.js and will use React/Redux to create a social media app clone.
+ Later, I plan to employ React Native to make apps that are cross-platform compatible.
+ Finally, Node.js and MondoDB will fill-in the backend server side of the website, allowing it to store and sort user data.
