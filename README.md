## Hey there! I'm Henry, a Software Engineer :computer:

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently working on my Master of Science in Data Science at Eastern University. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for Data Science with an emphasis on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
    
ðŸŽ“ Previously, I graduated with Honors from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp's Full Stack Web + Mobile Development Program with a focus in React, React Native, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

ðŸ”­ Additionally, I'm learning best practices for TypeScript, C#, and MSSQL Server for my current job as a Software Engineer.

ðŸ“± Using React Native, I built a clone of the popular climbing app, Kaya, that serves as both a guide and logbook.

âš¡ Fun fact: Before switching careers, I was a 4th-5th grade educator in a Dual-Language program (English / Spanish).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for open source and my aspirations to ensure that everyone has access to an engaging and quality education.
