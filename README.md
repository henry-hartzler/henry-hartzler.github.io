# Henry Hartzler, Software Developer

## Portfolio Website
+ This website showcases my keen attention to detail, mastery in JavaScript, and expertise in both responsive web design and CSS animations.

## What I'm working on:
+ Working towards certification with honors in Full Stack Web + Mobile Development through Nucamp Coding Bootcamp.
+ Currently, I am using the React.js library and will use React/Redux to create a social media app clone.
+ Later, I plan to employ React Native to make apps that are cross-platform compatible.
+ Finally, Node.js and MongoDB will fill-in the backend server side of the website, allowing it to store and sort user data.
